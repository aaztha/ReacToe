# ReacToe
This is the Tic-Tac-Toe Game made using ReactJs - my first project on ReactJs.

To have this game,you need to follow the steps given below:
Step1 : Download this github repository.

Step2 : Setup the local environment of ReactJs.
(PS:I use Yarn for the package manager and windows as OS.)

Step3 : Write the following command in the console: 
>create-react-app tictactoe.
In this way,You have created the directory named as "tictactoe". 

Step4 : Now replace the default src folder (which is inside the directory), with the src folder of this downloaded github repository.
Now you are ready to run  this file!

Step5 : To run this file,use the following command:
>cd tictactoe
>yarn start

Congratulations! You’ve created a tic-tac-toe game that:

->Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
->Indicates when a player has won the game,
->Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
->Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.
